# Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the structure and layout of a web page or application. It focuses on how content and elements are arranged before adding colors, images, or final design details.

## Importance of Wireframing
Wireframing is a crucial step in the design process because it:
- Helps visualize the basic structure of a product.
- Allows designers and developers to discuss layout and functionality early.
- Saves time and effort before moving to high-fidelity design and coding.
